## About Breaktime App

I'm a full-time software tester and coding hobbyist.  I often use the Pomodoro Method to track my productivity throughout the day.  However, I find that, when I'm stuck on a difficult coding issue or bug, I will skip my Pomo break to continue working.  

Delaying time away decreases my actual productivity, so I decided to start tracking my 5 - 15 minute breaks instead of tracking my Pomodoros.  Hopefully, this little App will keep me honest!
